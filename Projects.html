                <p> <ul>
                      <li>Developed 3 versions of a dice game using Python: Turn Pig for solo play with strategic decision-making, Solitaire Pig with a player-defined target score,
                          and Heads-up Pig for two-player competitive rounds </li>
                      <li>Applied unique rules for each version, such as continuous rolling in Turn Pig, target score persistence 
                          in Solitaire Pig, and competitive head-to-head play in Heads-up Pig</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Built a multi-round election simulator using Ranked Choice Voting logic with dynamic ballot adjustment and candidate elimination.</li>
                      <li>Developed methods to parse input, tally votes, analyze outcomes, and remove lowest-ranked candidates.</li>
                      <li>Handled edge cases like exhausted ballots and shifting tallies; output included vote counts and percentages.</li>
                        <li>Gained practical insights into election fairness and voter representation through algorithmic design.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Developed a command-line roulette simulator supporting Straight, Even/Odd, Column, and Dozen bets.</li>
                      <li>Implemented bet evaluation logic with random.randint() and handled edge cases (0, 00).</li>
                      <li>Built and tested modular functions using a provided test suite to ensure accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Applied clean coding practices, function decomposition, and test-driven development.</li>

                <p> <ul>
                  <li>Designed and executed a comprehensive database system for analyzing five years (2014-2018) of 
                      football data from six major European leagues, utilizing MySQL, Python, and Metabase for data storage, 
                      processing, and visualization</li>
                  <li>Created a relational database in (3NF) using MySQL Workbench, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval</li>
                  <li>Built a Metabase dashboard with interactive visualizations to analyze team performance, rankings, and trends over 5 seasons </li>
