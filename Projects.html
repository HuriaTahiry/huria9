                <p> Developed 3 versions of a dice game using Python: Turn Pig for solo play with strategic 
                    decision-making, Solitaire Pig with a player-defined target score, and Heads-up Pig for 
                    two-player competitive rounds 
Applied unique rules for each version, such as continuous rolling in Turn Pig, target score persistence in 
                    Solitaire Pig, and competitive head-to-head play in Heads-up Pig

                <a href="https://github.com/HuriaTahiry/Ranked-Choice-Voting" > Ranked Choice Voting     </a>
                <p>
                    Developed a Ranked Choice Voting simulation using Java, implementing a multi-round elimination process
                    to determine election winners through a majority-based system. The simulation accounted for ranked candidate
                    preferences on each ballot and dynamically adjusted as candidates were eliminated.

Built key methods including convert() to parse raw ballot data into structured Ballot objects, tallies() to count first-choice 
                    votes, analyze() to determine winners or lowest-ranked candidates, and remove() to eliminate candidates and 
                    adjust ballots accordingly.

Created a flexible system to handle any valid input file, including edge cases like ballot exhaustion and shifting vote tallies. 
                    Final output included both numerical and percentage breakdowns of each candidateâ€™s performance.

This project highlighted the complexity and fairness of Ranked Choice Voting compared to traditional systems, offering insights
                    into voter representation and election design.

                <p>
                    Python | Object-Oriented Programming | Randomization | Unit Testing | Logic Implementation

Developed a fully functional roulette game simulator in Python that replicates four major bet types: Straight, Even/Odd, Column, and Dozen.

Implemented logic for calculating win/loss conditions based on randomized outcomes using random.randint() with proper edge case handling for 0 and 00 values.

Built individual functions to determine outcomes and payouts for each bet type, applying conditional and mathematical logic to validate bets and enforce game rules.

Designed and tested modular functions using a provided test suite (tester.py), ensuring accuracy and robustness of bet evaluation logic.

Enhanced user experience with clear game prompts and result feedback in the command-line interface.

Followed software engineering best practices including function decomposition, code documentation, and test-driven development. </p></div>

                <p>
                   Designed and executed a comprehensive database system for analyzing five years (2014-2018) of football data from six major European leagues, utilizing MySQL, Python, and Metabase for data storage, processing, and visualization
Created a relational database in (3NF) using MySQL Workbench, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval
Built a Metabase dashboard with interactive visualizations to analyze team performance, rankings, and trends over 5 seasons
